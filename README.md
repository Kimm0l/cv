# Awesome CV [![Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/master/examples/resume.pdf)


[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

## How to Use
### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

### Usage

At a command prompt, run
```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
